Hi I'm Anton.

Recently graduated from the Hogeschool Rotterdam' program Make AI Work (applied artificial intelligence)

On my github you will find some of the work I've done for this program and some of my spare time projects. 

I'm working on a portfolio website to make a more easy to navigate showcase of my capabilities. You will find the link here when this is finished.

Have a great day!
